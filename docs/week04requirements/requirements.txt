1. Gameplay Mechanics
As a player, I want to place turrets on the grid so that I can develop defensive strategies.

Players can click or drag turrets onto valid placement grids.
Once placed, turrets automatically attack monsters within range.
Players cannot place turrets on obstacles or restricted areas.
After placing a turret, the UI displays the current gold expenditure and remaining resources.

As a player, I want different types of turrets with unique abilities so that I can choose the best defense strategy.

The game offers at least three different turret types (e.g., single-target attack, area-of-effect attack, slow effect turret).
Different turrets have varying effects on monsters, such as the slow turret reducing monster movement speed.
Players can view turret descriptions to help select the optimal defensive strategy.

As a player, I want monsters to follow a predetermined path so that I can predict their movement trajectory.

Monsters move along a fixed path on the map and do not deviate.
Monster movement speed can change due to special effects (e.g., slow turrets).
The path is clearly visible at the beginning of the level, allowing players to plan their strategy in advance.

2. Progression & Difficulty
As a player, I want monster waves to gradually become more difficult to maintain game challenge.

Each wave increases monster health or movement speed compared to the previous one.
The game features at least five monster types of varying strength (e.g., regular monsters, elite monsters, and bosses).
A game mechanism controls the gradual difficulty increase, introducing new monster types at specific waves.

As a player, I want to earn in-game currency by defeating monsters so that I can upgrade turrets.

Players earn a certain amount of gold for each defeated monster.
The UI clearly displays the player's current gold and available resources.
Players can use gold to upgrade turrets, improving their attack power or range.

As a player, I want difficulty settings so that I can adjust the challenge based on my skill level.

The game offers at least three difficulty modes (Easy, Normal, Hard).
Different difficulty modes affect monster health, speed, and attack waves.
Players can select a difficulty before starting a game and adjust it under specific conditions (e.g., when restarting a level).

3. Graphics & UI
As a player, I want an intuitive UI that clearly displays my resources and turret placements.

The UI displays current gold, remaining lives, and monster wave information.
When selecting a turret, valid placement areas are highlighted.
Resource numbers update in real-time to reflect player actions (e.g., gold decreases after purchasing a turret).

As an artist, I want to design visually distinct monster types so that players can easily recognize threats.

Each monster type has a unique appearance or color to distinguish them (e.g., small monsters vs. boss monsters).
Monsters have different animation effects when moving to enhance visual feedback.
Monster types are introduced or labeled before a level begins.

As a UI designer, I want to create a pause menu so that players can restart or change settings.

Players can open the menu via a pause button, which halts the game state.
The menu includes options such as "Resume Game," "Restart," and "Exit."
Players can adjust settings like volume and difficulty within the menu.

4. Sound & Feedback
As a player, I want sound effects when placing turrets and defeating monsters to provide immediate feedback.

A sound effect plays when a turret is successfully placed.
Defeating monsters triggers a sound effect to enhance the sense of achievement.
Turrets emit shooting sounds when attacking to improve immersion.

As a sound designer, I want background music to change with monster waves to enhance immersion.

Early waves play light background music, while higher difficulty waves have intense music.
Boss levels trigger unique background music to increase tension.
Players can adjust or disable background music in the settings menu.

As a player, I want visual and sound feedback when upgrading turrets to confirm a successful upgrade.

A sound effect plays upon upgrading a turret, accompanied by a flash or special animation.
The UI displays the upgraded turret’s new abilities (e.g., increased attack power or range).
Upgraded turrets change in appearance to allow for easy identification.

These acceptance criteria ensure the game’s completeness in terms of gameplay, progression, visuals, 
and sound while providing clear standards for the development team to follow.
